# Cold-Start Growth Strategy for APOXER.COM

Execution-focused plan for launching a matchmaking discovery platform. Prioritize visible activity and social proof over traffic volume.

**Core Principle**: APOXER is a discovery layer, not a Discord replacement. We help gamers find active lobbies and players, then they play elsewhere.

## Cold-Start Seeding

**Goal**: Create visible activity before public launch. Empty lobbies = dead platform.

### NOW (Week 1-2)

#### 1. **Seed 3-5 Target Games**
- [ ] Identify 3-5 niche games with active communities but poor matchmaking
- [ ] Create 2-3 lobbies per game manually (use test accounts)
- [ ] Ensure lobbies show as "active" with realistic player counts
- [ ] Add descriptive lobby titles that match real player needs

#### 2. **Manual Activity Seeding**
- [ ] Post 5-10 messages in each seeded lobby (spread over days)
- [ ] Create "recently active" history (close/reopen lobbies to show activity)
- [ ] Ensure homepage shows at least 10-15 "active now" lobbies
- [ ] Add game covers and proper metadata to all seeded games

#### 3. **Social Proof Elements**
- [ ] Display "X players online" counter (even if seeded)
- [ ] Show "X lobbies active" on homepage
- [ ] Add "Recently joined" timestamps (make them recent)
- [ ] Create "trending games" section with your target games

### NEXT (Week 3-4)

#### 4. **Invite Real Users (Soft Launch)**
- [ ] Invite 10-20 friends/colleagues who play target games
- [ ] Ask them to create 1-2 real lobbies
- [ ] Encourage them to invite 1-2 friends each
- [ ] Goal: 30-50 real users creating organic activity

#### 5. **Activity Maintenance**
- [ ] Monitor lobby activity daily
- [ ] If activity drops, manually seed more lobbies
- [ ] Keep at least 5-10 active lobbies visible at all times
- [ ] Rotate which games show activity (don't let any look dead)

### LATER (Month 2+)

- [ ] Reduce manual seeding as organic activity grows
- [ ] Focus seeding only on new games you're launching
- [ ] Use analytics to identify which games need seeding support

## Game Selection Strategy

**Goal**: Focus on 3-5 games where players are desperate for matchmaking.

### Criteria for Target Games

1. **Active but Fragmented Community**
   - Game has players, but they struggle to find teammates
   - Existing matchmaking is broken or non-existent
   - Players post "LFG" (Looking for Group) frequently

2. **Niche but Not Dead**
   - 1K-50K concurrent players (not too small, not too big)
   - Active subreddit with regular "find teammates" posts
   - Discord servers exist but are too large/noisy

3. **Matchmaking Pain Points**
   - In-game matchmaking is slow/broken
   - No ranked team finder
   - Cross-platform play needs external coordination
   - Competitive scene exists but lacks organization

### How to Identify Target Games

#### Research Checklist
- [ ] Search Reddit: `[game name] find teammates` or `[game name] LFG`
- [ ] Check subreddit activity: 5+ "looking for group" posts per day
- [ ] Verify game has active player base (Steam Charts, active.gg)
- [ ] Check if game has broken/inadequate matchmaking
- [ ] Confirm no dominant matchmaking platform exists for this game

#### Example Target Games (Research These)
- Older competitive games with active but fragmented communities
- Indie multiplayer games with growing player bases
- Games with cross-platform play but no unified matchmaking
- Early access games with active Discord but no organized lobbies

### Game Selection Action Plan

**Week 1**: Research 10-15 potential games
- [ ] Create spreadsheet: Game name, subreddit activity, player count, matchmaking status
- [ ] Rank by: Community need + player count + growth potential

**Week 2**: Validate top 5
- [ ] Join each game's subreddit/Discord
- [ ] Count "LFG" posts over 3 days
- [ ] Test existing matchmaking solutions (if any)
- [ ] Finalize 3-5 target games

**Week 3**: Deep dive on selected games
- [ ] Create game-specific landing pages
- [ ] Seed initial lobbies
- [ ] Prepare Reddit engagement strategy

### Page Structure
